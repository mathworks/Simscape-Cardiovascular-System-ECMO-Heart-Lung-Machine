The Cardiovascular model can be used to simulate the flows and pressures of the human cardiovascular system. You can model simulate scenarios such as increased systemic resistance and also use the model for development of ECMO machines and heart-lung machines. The demo comes with a self-explanatory live script to demonstrate the capabilities of the model. A novel ECMO machine is also implemented for closed-loop simulation.

## Setup 
To Run:
1. Open project-file
2. The live-script will open automatically. Run each section as you read.
